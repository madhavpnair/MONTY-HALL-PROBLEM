  <li><b>Interactive version of the game takes user i/p two times</b></li>
  <li><b>Semi-interactive version of the game takes a single user i/p </b></li>
  <li><b>The automated simulation hears only the number of test cases from the user</b></li>

<h2><b>Conditional Probabilistic Results and Explanation<b></h2>

<div>
  Conditional probability involves calculating the likelihood of an event occurring, given that 
  another event has already occurred. This is commonly expressed as:
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <p style="color:red;">
    P(A|B)=P(A∩B)/P(B)</p>
    P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A given that B has occured<br>
    P(A∩B) is the probability of both A and B occuring<br>
    P(B) is the probability of B occuring<br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  Let's apply conditional probability to the Monty Hall problem. The key events here are:<br>
  A: You win by switching.<br>
  B: Monty opens a door of an empty room (or a room having goat - another narrative of the same   problem)<br>
  Initially, there is a 1/3 chance that you pick the car, and a 2/3 chance that you pick a goat. 
  <b>Monty's action (opening a goat door) gives you additional information about where the car is, leading to the key insight of the problem: you are twice as likely to win if 
  you switch.</b>b><br>
