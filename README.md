  <li><b>Interactive version of the game takes user i/p two times</b><li>
  <li><b>Semi-interactive version of the game takes a single user i/p </b><li>
  <li><b>The automated simulation hears only the number of test cases from the user</b><li>

<h2><b>Conditional Probabilistic Results and Explanation<b></h2>
<hr>
  
<div>Conditional probability involves calculating the likelihood of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred. This is commonly expressed as:</div>

    <div> P(A|B)=P(Aâˆ©B)/P(B)
    P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A given that B has occured
